# Untitled Factory Game

Small factorio-like game I'm working on, with [LÃ–VE2D](https://www.love2d.org). 


# features

## player + camera

- The player can move on the whole map.

- Viewporting / camera system that move switch player movement as it's in most of top down 2D games.

## map + generation

- Map is randomly generated 

- Now there are only 3 types of "blocks" (`grass`, `iron` and `coal`) with Jo interaction for now.

## building

- There's the start of building framework, you can build in all four directions.v

- Now the building isn't implemented and the code only checks on which squares the player is (X, Y).

# future

- I want to add the building to work and the buildings. 

- I want to make some UI for the game.

- I want to make it have pixel art graphics. 

- And more...

# Untitled Factory Game

Small factorio-like game I'm working on, with [LÃ–VE2D](https://www.love2d.org). 


# features

## player + camera

- The player can move on the whole map.

- Viewporting / camera system that move switch player movement as it's in most of top down 2D games.

## map + generation

-Map is randomly generated 

-Now there are only 3 types of "blocks".

-grass, iron and coal, with Jo interaction for now.

## building

There's the start of building framework, you can build in all four cardinal directions. Now the building isn't implemented and the code only checks on which squares the player is (X, Y) in future it'll be able to place building according to what you need / want.

# future

I want to add the building to work and the buildings. I want to make some UI for the game and I want to make it have pixel art graphics (which I maybe won't make). Maybe I'll add more but I don't know now.
